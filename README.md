# Purpose of tell_georef.py

The purpose of this script is to read the metadata of a series of .jp2 files and
create a .csv file with the names of the files that are georeferenced and another
.csv file with the non-georeferenced.
It uses ExifTool http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/ so you need to install
it before running the script
